## About

The English, nor the Spanish language can fully capture the depths and complexity of my thoughts. But I do my best to make it work by being clear, relatable, funny, informative, and thorough 👩🏽‍🏫 📖.

Born and raised in Dominican Republic, I immigrated to NYC in my teenage years and now reside in New Jersey. Defying all odds against becoming a writer - rather than following in my family's footsteps with careers in medicine, business, accounting, or teaching - I tightly held on to my dream, graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelors in Creative Writing, and am now a Professional Full-Time Senior Technical Writer, and a Freelance Writer in fields of Marketing and Journalism. I am also a devoted and busy mom to four boys 👦🏽, who are the light ✨ of my life, along with my two fur babies 🐈 🐈‍⬛.
