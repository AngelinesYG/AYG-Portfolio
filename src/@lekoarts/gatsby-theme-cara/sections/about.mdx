## About

The English, nor the Spanish language can fully capture the depths and complexity of my thoughts. But I do my best to make it work by being clear, relatable, funny, informative, and thorough 👩🏽‍🏫 📖.

Born and raised in the Dominican Republic, I immigrated to NYC in my early teenage years and now reside in New Jersey. Defying all odds against becoming a writer - rather than following in my family's footsteps with careers in medicine, business, accounting, or teaching; and going against all those who said I should follow a more "realistic" carrer path (and many other hardships) - I tightly held on to my dream of becoming a professional writer. I graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelors in Creative Writing, and then enrolled in a bootcam to study Software Engineering. I am now a Professional Full-Time, Senior Technical Writer, and a Freelance Writer in the fields of Marketing and Journalism. I still can't believe I get to write for a living!🔥 🎉 

I am also a devoted and busy mom to four very energetic boys 👦🏽, who are the light ✨ of my life, along with my two fur babies 🐈 🐈‍⬛.
