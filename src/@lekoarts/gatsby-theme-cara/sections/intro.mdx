# Welcome to AYG Portfolio! 

My name is Angelines, and I'm a creative and technical writer, with over ten years of experience writing in multiple different genres and writing styles, and for multiple different audiences. I enjoy creating documentation that is clear, concise, relatable, easy to understand, and at times, entertaining.  ☺️ 👩🏽‍💻 ✨ 

Please take a look at my projects and writing samples.
