# Welcome to AYG Portfolio! 

My name is Angelines, AKA Angie. I am a technical communicator and creative writer. I have over ten years of experience writing in multiple different genres and writing styles; and for multiple different audiences. My passion and dedicatin for writing led me in different directions that ultimately led me to where I am today and I could not be happier. I absolutely love writing and editing, and enjoy consistent learning to improve my skills. My goal is to create content that is clear, concise, relatable, easy to understand, and even entertaining; depending on the audience, of course.  ☺️ 👩🏽‍💻 ✨
