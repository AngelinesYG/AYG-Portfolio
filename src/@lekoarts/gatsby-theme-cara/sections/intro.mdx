# <code style="color: magenta">Welcome to AYG's Portfolio!</code> 

My name is Angelines (call me Angie). I am a bilingual technical communicator and creative writer. I have over ten years of experience writing in multiple different genres and styles and for many different audiences. My passion and dedication for writing sent me in different directions that ultimately led me to where I am today and I could not be happier. I absolutely love writing and editing, and I enjoy constantly learning to improve my skills. My goal is to create content that is clear, concise, relatable, easy to understand, and even entertaining (depending on the audience, of course). ☺️ 👩🏽‍💻 ✨

Please take a look at my projects and writing samples.
